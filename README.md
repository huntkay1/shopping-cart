# React + Vite

Design inspiration for this project came from:
https://dribbble.com/shots/22688248-Ecommerce-Website-Design

<b>This website is still under construction</b>, but I added it to view on GitHub as I continue to build and add features. 

The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning ecommerce site (without the ability to complete a purchase)

<i>This site is not yet available on mobile.</i>

With this project, I have learned how to:
    - use React Router
    - implement the UseContext API
    - create and use a custom hook
    - create and use my own database
    - build my own REST API
    - build a responsive, collapisble navbar
