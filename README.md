# React + Vite

Design inspiration for this project came from:
https://dribbble.com/shots/22688248-Ecommerce-Website-Design

<b>This website is still under construnction</b>, but I added it to view on GitHub as I continue to build and add features. 

The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning ecommerce site (without the ability to complete a purchase)

The next features that I will be adding are:
- adding to shopping cart
- creating a custom database (possibly a custom API)
