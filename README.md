# React + Vite

Design inspiration for this project came from:
https://dribbble.com/shots/22688248-Ecommerce-Website-Design

<b>Site accessible here:</b> https://poetic-starlight-e42a0f.netlify.app/

This is a fully funcitonal e-commerce site (without the ability to purchase) for the fictional plant shop "Leafy Greens".

While creating this site, I decided I would like to build my own
database, coupled with a custom-built API. For this reason, I learned
SQL/MySQL, Express.js, and Node.js. The API was successful and the 
code for it is accessible here: https://github.com/huntkay1/plant-shop-api

In order to find a cost-effective host for this data, I opted to creating a database with Supabase and utilized their API.


With this project, I have learned how to:
    - use React Router
    - implement the UseContext API
    - create and use a custom hook
    - create and use my own database
    - build my own REST API
    - build a responsive, collapisble navbar
